# **Fashion Tagger: AI-Powered Fashion Image Labeling**

## Dataset Explanation

Fashion Tagger uses the **Fashion Product Images Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains over 44,000 fashion product images with detailed labels such as category, color, and season. This dataset is crucial for training our AI model to accurately predict fashion item attributes.

- **Dataset Source**: [Fashion Product Images Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset).

## Project Overview

Fashion Tagger is a web application that classifies fashion items using an AI model trained on the Kaggle dataset. The model, built using an ensemble of CNNs, predicts labels like category and color for each uploaded image. The application provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the model, making AI-powered fashion labeling accessible and easy to use.

## **Quick Start Guide**

### **Environment Setup**
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Set up your environment and install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install flask torch torchvision timm joblib pytorch-lightning
```

### **Running the Application**
To run the Flask application locally:
```bash
python app.py
```

### **Accessing the Application**
Once the application is running, you can access it via your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## **Dataset Explanation**

The model is trained on the [Fashion Product Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset). This dataset contains thousands of images labeled with categories, subcategories, colors, and other fashion-related attributes. The dataset was preprocessed by resizing images and normalizing pixel values.

## **Model Training**

The machine learning model used in this project is an ensemble of EfficientNet, ResNet, and MobileNet architectures. The training process involved several steps, including data augmentation, stratified sampling, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. For a detailed explanation of the model training, refer to the `preprocess_and_train` directory.

## **Application Workflow**

### **Backend**
The backend is built using Flask, which handles routing, file uploads, and serving the AI model for inference. The model is loaded and served using PyTorch, and predictions are made based on the uploaded images.

### **Frontend**
The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user interface. The front end provides an intuitive user experience, guiding users from image upload to viewing prediction results.

## **Application Performance**

Fashion Tagger accurately predicts labels for various fashion items, demonstrating the effectiveness of the underlying AI model. Below is a summary of the applicationâ€™s performance:

- **Prediction Accuracy**: High accuracy across multiple fashion categories.
- **Speed**: Real-time predictions for each uploaded image.

## **Future Work and Enhancements**

- **Model Improvement**: Further fine-tune the model to increase prediction accuracy.
- **Dataset Expansion**: Incorporate more diverse fashion datasets to improve model robustness.
- **Production Deployment**: Explore options for deploying the application using cloud services or Docker.
